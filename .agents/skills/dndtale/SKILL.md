## What Dndtale Does

This skill helps you create:

---

## Core Principles

### Creative Voice
- Write with evocative, atmospheric prose — lead with mood, not measurements (see [creative-voice.md](modules/creative-voice.md))
- Engage multiple senses in every scene description
- Give every NPC a want, a speech pattern, and an opinion
- Design encounters as drama engines, not math problems

### Player Agency First
- Always provide multiple solutions to problems
- Design consequences that matter and ripple forward
- Avoid railroading (forced single paths)
- Let player choices shape the story
- Character backstories are campaign fuel — weave them in

### Usability at the Table
- Write clear, scannable DM notes
- Provide concise read-aloud text
- Include quick reference tables
- Anticipate common DM needs

### Completeness and Consistency
- Cross-reference between documents
- Maintain timeline and logic
- Keep names and facts consistent
- Check dependencies when changing content

### Use the Right Tools
- **TaskCreate/TaskUpdate:** Track complex campaign creation tasks
- **AskUserQuestion:** Clarify requirements and gather preferences
- **Read:** Always read existing files before editing
- **Edit:** Make targeted changes to existing content
- **Write:** Create new files from templates
- **dndig:** Generate campaign artwork (see [dndig-reference.md](modules/dndig-reference.md))

├── chapter-02.md                # Continue for each chapter/session
├── chapters-summary.md          # Chapter/Scene-level summaries for all chapters of the campaign
├── npcs.md                      # Important characters with stats and motivations
├── locations.md                 # Key places with descriptions

## Important Guidelines

### Always Do This

**Use TaskCreate/TaskUpdate for Complex Tasks**
- Create planning checklist immediately with TaskCreate
- Track progress through creation phases
- Mark tasks completed with TaskUpdate as you finish them
- Keep exactly ONE task in_progress at a time

**Ask Questions When Needed**
- Use AskUserQuestion for unclear requirements
- Clarify tone, content boundaries, player preferences
- Ask about multiple valid approaches
- Don't guess—confirm with the DM

**Read Before Editing**
- Always Read existing files before using Edit
- Understand the full context
- Check dependencies and cross-references
- Maintain consistency with existing content

**Preserve Player Agency**
- Provide multiple solutions to every problem
- Design meaningful consequences
- Allow creative approaches
- Avoid forced single paths

**Follow Templates**
- Use the templates in [templates/](templates/)
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Include all required sections
- Match the style of examples

### Never Do This

**Don't Railroad Players**
- Never force a single solution
- Don't invalidate player choices
- Avoid "the NPC does everything" solutions

**Don't Skip Quality Checks**
- Always use checklists before completion
- Verify cross-references work
- Check name consistency
- Test story logic

**Don't Forget Documentation**
- Cross-reference between documents
- Link to related content
- Include DM notes and tips
- Provide stat blocks or references

**Don't Break Existing Content**
- When editing, maintain story logic
- Update all references to changed content
- Check timeline consistency
- Preserve what works

---

## Session Zero Considerations

Unless stated otherwise, campaigns are written for consenting adults. When content might be disturbing or NSFW:

- Include content warnings in README.md
- Suggest Session Zero discussion topics
- Recommend safety tools (X-Card, Lines & Veils)
- Clearly mark mature content

---

## Standard D&D Adventure Structure

The skill follows professional D&D adventure conventions (see [STRUCTURE.md](STRUCTURE.md) for full details):

**Front Matter:** Introduction, synopsis, hooks
**Core Structure:** Chapter breakdown with scenes, encounters, NPCs
**Climax:** Epic final encounter with multiple resolution paths
**Back Matter:** Appendices with stat blocks, magic items, handouts

**Each Chapter Includes:**
- Read-aloud text for scene setting
- DM information and secrets
- Encounter design (combat, social, skill challenges)
- NPCs with personality and stats
- Treasure and rewards
- Connections to other chapters

---

## Formatting Standards

Follow conventions in [modules/formatting-conventions.md](modules/formatting-conventions.md):

**Read-Aloud Text:**
```markdown
> Text the DM reads to players
> Detailed, evocative, multi-sensory
> Present tense, no secrets
```

**DM Notes:** Regular text with mechanical details, secrets, contingencies

**Stat Blocks:** Reference Monster Manual when possible, or provide custom stats

**Cross-References:** Use markdown links: `[Chapter 2](chapter-02.md)` or `[NPCs](npcs.md#npc-name)`

**Image Prompts:** Create in `art/` folder with proper metadata

---

## Quick Reference

### Campaign Types
- **Linear:** Sequential chapters, clear path (easiest to prep)
- **Sandbox:** Central hub, many options (most prep)
- **Event-Based:** Timeline of events, player actions affect outcomes
- **Setting-Based:** Location-focused, exploratory

See: [modules/campaign-types.md](modules/campaign-types.md)

### Encounter Design
- Every fight answers: *"Why is this fight happening, and what changes when it's over?"*
- Terrain is the third combatant — environment should force choices
- Give enemies goals beyond "kill the party" (escape, protect, buy time, capture)
- Use the Encounter Design Checklist: dramatic question, stakes, environment, multiple approaches, escalation, connection
- Track variety with the Encounter Variety Matrix (combat/social/exploration/hybrid subtypes)
- Boss fights need phases, legendary actions, emotional stakes, and multiple victory conditions

See: [modules/encounter-design.md](modules/encounter-design.md)

### NPC Design
- **Tier 1 (Walk-On):** One trait, one useful thing, a rememberable name
- **Tier 2 (Recurring):** Want vs. need, opinions about other NPCs, a secret, speech patterns
- **Tier 3 (Major):** Full inner life, independent arc, mechanical weight, voice, relationship web
- **Villains:** Motivation, Method, Vulnerability, Escalation, Mirror

See: [modules/world-building.md](modules/world-building.md), [templates/npcs.md](templates/npcs.md)

### Location Design
- Atmosphere (sights, sounds, smells, feel)
- History and current situation — use environmental storytelling
- NPCs present and encounters
- Secrets to discover — layered puzzles that reward curiosity

See: [modules/world-building.md](modules/world-building.md), [templates/locations.md](templates/locations.md)

---

## Tone and Content

**Adjust to DM's requested tone:**
- Heroic & Epic
- Dark & Serious
- Humorous & Lighthearted
- Mystery & Intrigue
- Horror
- Adult-themed/NSFW (with appropriate warnings)

**Always:**
- Match requested tone consistently
- Warn about mature content in briefing
- Provide Session Zero guidance for sensitive topics

---

## Image Generation with dndig

Use **dndig** (`../dndig`) to generate campaign artwork from prompt files. See [dndig-reference.md](modules/dndig-reference.md) for complete documentation.

**Quick usage:**
```bash
dndig campaigns/my-campaign/art/throne-room.md --verbose
```

**Prompt file format:**
```markdown
---
title: throne-room
aspect_ratio: "16:9"
resolution: 2K
temperature: 0.8
batch: 2
instructions: campaign-style.md
references:
  - refs/gothic-castle.jpg

```

**Key features:**

- Important NPCs and character portraits (`2:3` or `3:4` at `2K`)
- Climactic encounters (`16:9` at `2K`)
